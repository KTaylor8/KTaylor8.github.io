# Snippets Extracted from Project during Expedia Software Development Apprenticeship


I worked within the Omni-Channel Communications (OCC) team to design and develop the initial stages of a system to help customers easily find events near their hotel and promote Expedia’s Things To Do. In our system, a target segment of customers that book a hotel will trigger an SMS/push notification that includes contains a deep link to a webpage with events near their hotel. The events are able to be sorted by distance, rating, or price. For each event, the customer is able to purchase tickets, map out the location of their event in relation to their hotel, and read other customers’ reviews among other options.

I focused primarily on the system’s ability to interact with numerous APIs and to use those responses to dynamically render various elements on our webpage and trigger notifications. I used JavaScript to code functionality such as handling user hotel data, generating the event cards, and visualizing the event and hotel locations on a map. I also helped to troubleshoot the HTML and CSS on the webpage displaying the events.

These are non-confidental code snippets that I coded in our project, for which the full code is confidental and now property of Expedia Group.
