I was selected to participate as a student in the seven-week-long Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Adobe, in which I learned a variety of programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Arduino C. For my final project, I collaborated with 3 other girls for 6 days to apply what we had learned in previous weeks to create a prototype of a safe space website prototype called Chatr (pronounced as "chatter") where girls can give and receive support female-oriented forums and view/post inspirational images.

Since the conclusion of Girls Who Code, I have continued building upon it a little in order to further hone my skills. My edits have mainly concerned optimizing the post and comment functions of the chatroom and designing a more user-friendly interface. The original version of Chatr as it was when we finished GWC can be found [here](https://gwc-chatr.github.io./)
